CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, "rightsholder(s)") of an
original work of authorship and/or a database (each and all, "work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a work
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate
in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he
or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the work,
voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the work and publicly distribute
the work under CC0, although aware that his or her rights in the work
may not be fully addressed by any or all of the remaining provisions
of this License.

Affirmer makes the following statement:

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all
of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and
causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as
well as future claims and causes of action), in the work (i) in all
territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending
that such Waiver shall not be subject to recall, rescission,
cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to
challenge the validity of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights or
affirmative action to enforce the Waiver.

Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this CC0 or use of the work.
